# ai-session-pin

Pin and resume Claude Code and Cursor agent sessions across project directories.

Both tools scope their own resume picker to the current working directory: `claude -r` reads `~/.claude/projects`, and `agent --resume` reads the chats bucketed under your workspace path. `ai-session-pin` lets you mark sessions from either tool as "pinned" and browse / resume them from anywhere, with a small TUI and a sessionId-prefix resolver.

## Features

- Pin the latest session in the current project, from either tool, or any session by id prefix
- One list across both tools, with a `SRC` column showing which one owns each row (`cc` / `cr`)
- Interactive TUI list with branch + last-modified info, stale-session marking, and `^X` to toggle pin state
- Resume a pinned session by id prefix or name substring
- Optional shell integration that cds your parent shell into the project directory on resume — so split panes, new tabs, and dev servers spawn in the right place
- Skills for pinning / unpinning the current session from inside Claude Code

## Install

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). You also need whichever agents you want to pin on your PATH: `claude` for Claude Code, `agent` for Cursor. Neither is mandatory, and sessions for a missing tool are simply never listed.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:dyl-young/ai-session-pin.git
cd ai-session-pin
pnpm install
pnpm link --global
```

This installs three bins on your PATH:

| Bin     | Action                       |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| `pin`   | Pin / umbrella CLI           |
| `pins`  | Open the pinned-sessions TUI |
| `unpin` | Unpin by token or by cwd     |

### Optional Shell integration (recommended)

The shell wrapper makes `pins → Enter` (resume) drop your parent shell into the project directory, so any new pane / tab you open during the session starts in the right place.

Add **one** line to your shell config:

```sh
# zsh / bash (in ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
eval "$(pin shell-init)"

# fish (in ~/.config/fish/config.fish)
pin shell-init fish | source
```

Then reload (`source ~/.zshrc` or open a new tab). Without it, the binaries still work; the cd-on-resume just won't trigger.

## Commands

| Command                               | What it does                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pin`                                 | Pin the most recently modified session in the current directory     |
| `pin <sessionId>`                     | Pin a specific session by id (full or unique prefix)                |
| `pin -n "..."` / `pin --name "..."`   | Pin and override the auto-derived display name (sticks through re-pins)              |
| `pin --sync-name`                     | Drop a custom name and follow the agent's own title again                            |
| `pins`                                | Open the interactive TUI (`↑↓` navigate, `⏎` resume, `^X` toggle, `^R` rename, `/` filter, `q` quit) |
| `pins <filter>`                       | Open the TUI prefiltered to pins whose project path contains `<filter>` (case-insensitive) |
| `pins <filter> -N`                    | Same, but match the chat name instead of the project path (`--by-name`, or `--by project\|name`) |
| `pins --plain`                        | Print a plain table for piping / scripting                          |
| `pins --all`                          | Include soft-deleted entries in the list                            |
| `unpin`                               | Soft-delete the pin matching the current directory                  |
| `unpin <token>`                       | Soft-delete a pin by id (full or prefix) or name substring          |
| `pin resume <token>`                  | Resume a pinned session directly (no TUI)                           |
| `pin purge`                           | Permanently drop all soft-deleted entries                           |
| `pin shell-init [zsh\|bash\|fish]`    | Print the shell wrapper (see [Shell integration](#shell-integration-recommended)) |

`<token>` matches a pin by **session id** (full or any unique prefix) or by **name substring** — whichever uniquely identifies one pin.

### Notes

- **Pinning:** display names come from the agent's own title, so they match what `claude -r` and Cursor's picker show. Rename a chat inside either tool and `pins` picks it up on the next listing. Override the name with `-n` / `--name` and it sticks through re-pins, until you pass `--sync-name` to follow the agent's title again.
- **Providers:** `pin` with no argument looks at both tools and takes whichever session in the directory was touched most recently. Resume runs `claude -r <id>` or `agent --resume=<id>` from the pin's project directory.
- **TUI:** `^X` stages a pin/unpin toggle on the highlighted row; changes apply when you quit. Soft-deleted entries hide from `pins` but still show in `pins --all`, where you can re-pin them with `^X`. Press `^R` to rename the highlighted row inline (`⏎` saves, `esc` cancels). Press `/` to filter rows live; `⏎` exits filter-edit mode and keeps the filter, `esc` clears it. Press `⇥` to switch what the filter matches — project path or chat name — which re-filters in place, so you can find a chat by name when you don't remember its project. The active scope is shown in the hint line (`filter project:` / `filter name:`), and `-N` / `--by name` sets the starting scope.
- **Skills:** inside Claude Code, the bundled `pin` / `unpin` skills (see [Skills](#skills)) wrap the same commands so you can pin without leaving the chat.

## Skills

The repo ships two Claude Code skills under `skills/`:

- `pin` — pins the current session (`pin add ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}`)
- `unpin` — unpins the current session (`pin rm ${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}`)

To use them, point your Claude Code skills directory at this repo's `skills/` folder.

## Storage

State lives at `~/.ai-session-pin/pins.json`. It's a small, human-readable JSON file, safe to delete to start fresh.

Two migrations happen on their own. Pins from before the rename get copied out of `~/.claude/pinned-sessions/pins.json` the first time you run any command, and the old file is left behind untouched so you can delete it once you're happy. Entries written before multi-provider support gain their `provider` and `nameSource` fields the next time the file is saved.

## Moving a project

Both agents key their history on the project's absolute path: Claude Code under an encoded copy of it, Cursor under an md5 of it. Move a project and both stores are orphaned while every pin points at a path that no longer exists.

`scripts/move-project.ts` repoints all of it. It runs as a dry run unless you pass `--apply`:

```sh
bun scripts/move-project.ts /old/path /new/path
bun scripts/move-project.ts /old/path /new/path --apply
```

It rewrites matching `projectPath` entries in `pins.json`, moves the Claude session directory, moves the Cursor chats directory, and rewrites the `cwd` recorded in each Cursor sidecar. It won't move the project itself; do that with `mv`, from outside the directory so nothing holds it open.

### If a session was running during the move

An agent recomputes its history directory from the working directory it captured at startup, so a session that is still running recreates the old directory and keeps writing there. Its history ends up split across both paths. The move warns when it sees a session file touched in the last two minutes.

Once that session exits, fold the leftovers in:

```sh
bun scripts/move-project.ts /old/path /new/path --reconcile --apply
```

Reconcile appends each stray Claude session file onto its moved counterpart, checking timestamp order first, and removes the old directory once it's empty. It skips any file written in the last minute, so it won't touch a session that is still live. Cursor chats can't be merged this way, since their history lives in SQLite rather than an append-only log; reconcile reports them instead and leaves them for you to move.

## Development

```sh
pnpm typecheck       # tsc --noEmit
bun src/cli.ts ...   # run the CLI directly without reinstalling
```

After a `pnpm link --global`, edits to source files are picked up immediately — no reinstall needed.
